			<div>BringYour was started to give people more control and visibility into their network and data. We're inspired by the CAT6 cable that connects the world's homes and data centers. Its elegant simplicity packs massive value (fast, secure, unbreakable) in a form that everyone can use - a click in of RJ45. You'll see the homage to a CAT6 <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cross_section_of_a_Cat6_patch_cable.jpg" target="_blank">cross-section</a> in our logo.</div>
			<div><br>Today we see a need for tools as simple as CAT6 for private networks that overlay the global public networks. Private networks are becoming increasingly relevant for everyday people to protect and assert their freedoms. While there are many options out there, none are as simple for the everyday user as a cable. We believe in a world where a cryptographically correct private network can be created and managed by anyone from an app, without the need (and maintenance overhead) of terminals, computers, routers, SSO, or additional dependencies.</div>
