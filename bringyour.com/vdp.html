<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Bring Your, LLC welcomes feedback from security researchers and the
general public to help improve our security. If you believe you have
discovered a vulnerability, privacy issue, exposed data, or other
security issues in any of our assets, we want to hear from you. This
policy outlines steps for reporting vulnerabilities to us, what we
expect, what you can expect from us.</p>
<h2 id="systems-in-scope">Systems in Scope</h2>
<p>This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or
maintained by Bring Your, LLC.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h2>
<ul>
<li>Assets or other equipment not owned by parties participating in this
policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems
should be reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable
authority.</p>
<h2 id="our-commitments">Our Commitments</h2>
<p>When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and
validate your report;</li>
<li>Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as
it is processed;</li>
<li>Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner,
within our operational constraints; and</li>
<li>Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related
to this policy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-expectations">Our Expectations</h2>
<p>In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good
faith, we ask that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other
relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy
and any other applicable terms, the terms of this policy will
prevail;</li>
<li>Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly;</li>
<li>Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems,
destroying data, and/or harming user experience;</li>
<li>Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information
with us;</li>
<li>Provide us a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from the
initial report) to resolve the issue before you disclose it
publicly;</li>
<li>Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and
activities which are out-of-scope;</li>
<li>If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the
amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively
demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report
immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as
Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare
Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information;</li>
<li>You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit
permission from the account holder; and</li>
<li>Do not engage in extortion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="official-channels">Official Channels</h2>
<p>Please report security issues via <a
href="mailto:security@bringyour.com"
class="email">security@bringyour.com</a>, providing all relevant
information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us
to triage and fix the issue.</p>
<h2 id="safe-harbor">Safe Harbor</h2>
<p>When conducting vulnerability research, according to this policy, we
consider this research conducted under this policy to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws, and we will
not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental,
good-faith violations of this policy;</li>
<li>Authorized concerning any relevant anti-circumvention laws, and we
will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology
controls;</li>
<li>Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service (TOS) and/or
Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP) that would interfere with conducting
security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis;
and</li>
<li>Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and
conducted in good faith.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. If
legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have
complied with this policy, we will take steps to make it known that your
actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p>
<p>If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your
security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report
through one of our Official Channels before going any further.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the Safe Harbor applies only to legal claims under the
control of the organization participating in this policy, and that the
policy does not bind independent third parties.</p>
